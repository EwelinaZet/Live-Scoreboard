# Live Football World Cup Score Board

A simple JavaScript + TypeScript library for live football match scoreboards.

You can start, update, and finish matches. The library allows you to get a live summary, sorted by total score and start time.


Team names are unique per match. No two matches with the same teams can run simultaneously. Scores must be non-negative integers.

## Testing

Tests are included in `test.ts`.

To run the tests, use:

```
npm test
```

or

```
npm run test
```
